// How to make the perfect turkey sandwich.
// 1. To start grab two good sized peices of bread (or a loaf of bread) anf slap them ontoa tray.
// 2. Next grab two slices of torkey a mayo jar (if you like mayo with torkey) cheese (preferably slices) get some onions tomatoes and lettuce if you want some extra flavor and put them all onto the tray.
// 3. Like origamy bend the torkey in half to be more space effecient and put the two slices of the torkey onto the left slice of  bread.
// 4. OPTIONAL, take the mayo and use a knife to put it onto the right peice of bread.
// 5. If you chose to put onions, tomaatoes, lettuce, or all three, what you want to  do is put whatever you chose FLAT on top of the turkey (after you cut them into good sized peices).
// 6. Take the cheese and put it on top of of everything you put on the left side of the bread.
// 7. If you would like to heat the sandwich put it into a microwave for 45 SECONDS ONLY, any longer and the cheese will deform and ruin the sandwich. If not then put it onto a respective plat and enjoy.
